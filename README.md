Droidian on Xiaomi Redmi 9A/9AT (dandelion)
========

## ATTENTION

all dandelion builds have been removed. more and more devices are being bricked because of xiaomi never updating their kernel but releasing newer versions of their devices.

Builds will no longer be generated. angelica will be the only mt6765 xiaomi left on the build system.
